						<h3>Our Original Logo</h3>		
						<p>
							One sunny afternoon, shortly after registering the company, Josh sat down with a vision in his mind. With unwavering determination and a knack for design, he sketched out the company's original logo. It was a moment of inspiration, where creativity met entrepreneurship. 
							<div>
								<span id = "text1" class = "hiddentext">The logo, a testament to his dedication, represented not only a roofing business but a dream taking flight.

						<h3>Our First Truck</h3>		
						<p>
							In the early days of Premium Roofing NZ, the company faced the exciting challenge of acquiring its first truck. Thanks to an exceptionally generous loan from an aunt, the dream became a reality. They scoured second-hand car dealerships until they found the perfect fit. 
							<div>
								<span id = "text2" class = "hiddentext">That truck wasn't just a vehicle; it symbolized growth and opportunity. It carried the team and their tools to countless job sites, fostering the company's reputation for reliability and dedication to customer service.

						<h3>Josh's Apprenticeship</h3>	
						<p>
							Josh's journey to becoming the leader of Premium Roofing NZ began with a transformative apprenticeship at "Complete Roofing" under the strict guidance of Darren Pollard.

							<div>
								<span id = "text4" class = "hiddentext">Darren's unwavering commitment to quality and precision became Josh's mantra. Today, Premium Roofing NZ stands as a testament to the exceptional quality instilled in Josh during his apprenticeship, delivering top-notch results to our valued customers.
